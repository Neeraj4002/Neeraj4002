## 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills

- **Backend & APIs:** FastAPI, WebSockets, asyncio, Dependency Injection
- **AI Orchestration:** LangGraph (state machines, events), LangChain
- **Vector DBs:** FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma
- **LLM Ops:** Prompt engineering, Cost optimization, Multi-LLM routing (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude)
- **Programming:** Python 3.10+, Type hints, Testing (pytest)
- **Frontend Integration:** Leaflet.js, WebSocket-based real-time updates
- **Deployment:** Render,Vercel, GitHub Actions

## 📈 Current Focus

- Building **AVIS (Agentic Coding System)**: a Python-based multi-agent framework for:
  - Backend API generation
  - ML/DL workflow automation
  - RAG over docs + Web search
  - Iterative error-checking & self-improvement

## 💡 My Motto

> “Write clean, modular, and resilient code — even if  AI generates, at the end of the day, you should be just capable of understanding it.”

- I **don’t** just connect APIs, I **optimize** them.
- I build **agents** that improve and adapt as I iterate things.
- I measure, test, and improve — no “it works on my machine” excuses.
